# Learn-with-Exercism

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains my solutions to basic Java exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org). I'm currently revisiting Java to strengthen my understanding of its core concepts.

Although I've previously studied Java, I believe that consistent practice and reflection are key to mastering any programming language. This journey is part of my broader goal to explore and deepen my knowledge across multiple languages, starting with Java.

Feel free to browse through the exercises, and thanks for stopping by!
